    Wherever you are in life, you matter to God, and you have a purpose. 
    We believe that life moves at the speed of relationships, and the most fulfilled people 
    are those with a strong, personal relationship with Christ, coupled with church community involvement. 
    We are so excited that you are considering United Awakening Pentecostal Church (U.A.P.C) as a place to call home. 
    It would be our honor to walk alongside you as you draw closer to Christ. 
    May we be the first to welcome you to The U.A.P.C Family.
